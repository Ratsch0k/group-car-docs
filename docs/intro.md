# Introduction
This documentation is meant for a place to document all of the project **Group Car**. Specifically, complex systems like authentication, session management, project structures, overall architecture and more. But as a quick disclaimer, because this project is just a hobby project, the documentation will most likely not be complete.

So far, this documentation is not complete.

## Motivation
**Group Car** was an idea which came up when everybody in my family had to share one car. This quickly became a problem. No one really knew where the car was parked and shouting through the house was not the best solution. My first approach was as a simple Android App that displayed our neighbourhood and allowed to place one car at predetermined spots. It was very basic, but it was sufficient for us. When a friend heard of my app and was interested it became apparent that this is an issue more families or friend groups could have. Thus, this project was born.
